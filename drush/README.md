The three subdirectories here hold project-specific commandfiles, site aliases, and configuration for Drush. These will all be included automatically when you use the vendor/bin/dr wrapper script that should be in your project root directory. The dr script intentionally skips loading commands/aliases/config from the typical global locations in order to ensure that all team members have same Drush environment.
 
 See http://packages.drush.org/ for a directory of Drush commands installable via Composer.
